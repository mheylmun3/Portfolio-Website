                    <p>
                        DataFest is a national data analysis competetition that I competed in and is sponsored by the American Statistical 
                        Association. In this competition, students attempt to derive the 
                        best insights for the client. The client and provider of the data that year was CourseKata. 
                        They wanted us to analyze multiple datasets that they obtained from one of their college textbooks for statistics. 
                        The textbook contained multiple versions and different college levels. The datasets were released to us at 6pm on 
                        Friday, and we had to turn everything in by noon on Sunday. We then gave a short presentation to a panel of judges 
                        of our findings.

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        The data we focused on was on the activity scores for each chapter and engagement of the students, measured by the 
                        time a student spent per page in minutes. Each chapter contained three seperate activities. There was a pre-assessment, 
                        where the students assessed their readiness to begin each chapter, activities throughout the chapter assessing their levels 
                        of comprehension, and a post assessment, asking the students how they felt about their comprehension of the chapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During our analysis, we found that there was a significant drop in engagement of the students in chapters five through ten, 
                        but no change in pre, mid, or end of chapter activity scores. In some cases, the average time spent per page by the students 
                        dropped by more than half. We concluded that the client make chapters five through ten more engaging and challenging, as the 
                        students seem ready to handle more complex content.

                    <p>
                        Among the Grand Valley State University participants, my group of four received two awards. We were honored with the 
                        Neal Rogness Collegiality Award for our exceptional teamwork and secured second place for the Best Visualizations Award, 
                        recognizing the visualizations I created.
